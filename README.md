# Crowdfunding_Analysis

##Overview

Organized and analyzed a database of 1,000 sample projects to uncover any hidden trends.

###Conclusions:
•	The crowdfunding was a success, but plays, music, film and video were the most successful overall. 
•	During the summer months of July through August generated the highest success of crowdfunding.
•	There appears to be higher failure and cancel rates in theater and journalism.

####Limitations and Suggestions: 
Some limitations with the data are that we can not see how much each donation was given per campaign backer only the average donation amount per company. 
To have a better understanding of the total dollar amount a table or graph showing the breakdown by country and currency could calculate the exact total raised.
A pivot table based on the country and year to help define why the trends of failure or cancellation is so high. This could explain the lack of engagement we see in journalism depending on the years the crowdfunding accorded. 
A table showing the campaign backers and the average donation to show the average amount of backers that fulfilled their donations specifically. 

#####Statistical Analysis:
The numbers show that the mean for successful campaign backers out-weighs the failed campaigns. This would justify my initial conclusion that the crowdfunding was a success.
